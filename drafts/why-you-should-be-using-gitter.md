# Why you should be using Gitter

So over the last year and half I have been increasing my involvement in open source. As part of that involvement, you really need to get plugged in to the community to effectively contribute to projects. It helps you learn the *ethos* of the project or projects and you start forming relationships that may turn into great, global, friendships. A fine example of that is the awesome [baby gift](https://twitter.com/gep13/status/835539880914612224) sent by the [Cake](http://cakebuild.net/) team to [Gary Park](http://www.gep13.co.uk/). These of the kinds of connections that can really boost your career and help you grow.  

The best way that I have found to do that is [Gitter](https://gitter.im). Gitter allows you to connect to the core team and community for many open source projects. As part of the connection you start learning personalities and founding principles of the maintainers and contributors. You also get a great insight in how to use the library and the best possible customer service when it comes to solving any issues you are having using the library. A fine example of awesome customer service would be the [Wyam](https://wyam.io/) project, [Dave Glick](https://daveaglick.com/) constantly works his tail off supporting users and he leaves no inquiry unanswered.

Orignaly, this post was going to be about how, I use [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) less now that Gitter exists, but in reality Gitter just turns that connection between *some code library* that you use and the community way up. It has become the go to place to find answers about any open source library. I always look for the Gitter channel and activity there first, before turning to StackOverflow. More than that it has become a place a hang out and get to geek out with like minded individuals and to achieve that community connection that brings most people to open source any.

With all that said, Thank you **Gitter** for empowering and strengthening the open source community.
